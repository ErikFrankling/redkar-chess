Basic moves:
        Pawn:
                Move forward (twice if its first move)
                Diagonal capture
        Bishop:
                Diagonal INF in all directions
        Knight:
                Two in one dir, one in perpendicular dir
        Rook:
                Straight INF in all directions
        Queen:
                Diagonal and Straight INF in all directions
        King:
                One step in all directions

Get valid moves or take input from user and check if move valid:
        1:
                get all possible moves and put into list
                Get input from user and check if move in list
        2:
                Get input from user and check if it is valid
        
        1 is faster if user is gonna make more move queries than possible valid moves
        However, this is probably negligible

Enum for Invalid move query maybe
