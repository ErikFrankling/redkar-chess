Pieces:
        Enum for Color:
                Black
                White
        Enum for PieceType:
                P, B, K, R, Q, K 
Basic moves:
        Pawn:
                Move forward (twice if its first move)
                Diagonal capture
        Bishop:
                Diagonal INF in all directions
        Knight:
                Two in one dir, one in perpendicular dir
        Rook:
                Straight INF in all directions
        Queen:
                Diagonal and Straight INF in all directions
        King:
                One step in all directions

Get valid moves or take input from user and check if move valid:
        1:
                get all possible moves and put into list
                Get input from user and check if move in list
        2:
                Get input from user and check if it is valid
        
        1 is faster if user is gonna make more move queries than possible valid moves
        However, this is probably negligible


Enum for Invalid move query maybe
        If in check:
                "All legal moves get you out of check"
                1. Capture attacking piece
                2. Block the attacker if its not a Knight
                3. Move the king to safety
        Out of bounds
        "Piece does not move like that"
        Putting your own king in check


If in check in and len(legal_moves) == 0:
        You are checkmated

Later:
